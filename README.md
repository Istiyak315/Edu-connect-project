## design decisions or assumptions
List your design desissions & assumptions

Decision Title: Regressive Automation Test Cases
Description: All possible test cases will be automated using Cypress.
Rationale:
Automation reduces the time and effort required for regression testing, allowing for faster release cycles.
Frees up manual testers to focus on exploratory testing and new feature testing.
Assumption Title: Users will have node installed and have stable internet connections
Description: The application assumes users will have node and reliable internet access.
Context: The app is web-based and requires internet connectivity and proper environment.
